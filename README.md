# Multi-Agent-Disaster-Response-and-Relief-Coordination-System

Design and implement a decentralized multi-agent system using SPADE or JADE to manage and coordinate emergency evacuation in a large building or complex. The system will simulate various agents representing occupants, emergency responders, and building management systems working together to ensure a safe and efficient evacuation during an emergency.
